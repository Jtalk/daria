This is DNS proxy client. It binds to the local address, making a simple
proxy server with transparent proxying via DNS servers. All the data is 
encoded with Base64 and sent as a URL request to the Arya DNS server, which
must be authoritative for the DNS zone entered.

Command: 
  ./daria --login=|-lLOGIN --password=|-pPASSWORD --server=|-sDNS_SERVER 
    --domain=|-dDOMAIN [ --buffer-size=|-bRECEIVE_BUFFER_SIZE --forking|-f --error=|-eLOGLEVEL ]
    
    LOGIN, PASSWORD:
      Login and password for this client. Now they can be any strings.
       
    DNS_SERVER:
      DNS server for that closed network. It will be used to reach remote Arya DNS server.
      
    DOMAIN:
      Domain for which Arya DNS is authoritative. You might need to register your own and check
      its NS entry to point to the Arya server.
      
    RECEIVE_BUFFER_SIZE:
      Size for receive buffer. Defaults are quite good.
      
    -f | --forking:
      Make this server a daemon. Only forks for POSIX systems, such as Linux or *BSD.
      
    LOGLEVEL:
      Logging level. The greater it is, the bigger logs would be.
      
Server does not provide any authorization now, it's just a test prototype, so use it on your own risk.
There's no encryption for data transfered, so it's better not to use that technique to transfer private data.
